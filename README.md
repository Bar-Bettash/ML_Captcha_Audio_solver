<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a basic demonstration of using Selenium WebDriver and the selenium_recaptcha_solver library to interact with a reCAPTCHA v2 challenge (for educational purposes only). It's important to understand that bypassing Captcha verification often violates the terms of service of the website you're trying to access. Use this code responsibly and ethically.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites


* Selenium WebDriver: A library for automating web browser interactions.
  ```sh
  pip install selenium


* selenium-recaptcha-solver (Optional): A library for solving captchas (not used in this specific code, but included for reference). 
  ```sh
  pip install selenium-recaptcha-solver

Note: This library's functionality may be unreliable and may not always work due to security updates.


### Installation

1. Download a webdrive that fits your operating system and web browser. For Chrome:
  ```sh
   https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads
```
2. Replace the driver path in the code to yours

3. Replace the target URL to the desired one. The default URL is a test link.
